# Statistical-Learning-

TODO: Add a pdf file on each exercise elaborating the mathematics behind the algorithms.

While learning machine learning by self study, I foud there are two great resources for the subject:

https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The programming assinments given in the former is in R while later is in Octave/Matlab. As a python user I decided to do the exercises in python. There are many topics overlapped from the two resources. While some of the topics are found only among one of them. In this repository I have done programming assigments from the former course. While the assignments from the later course have been solved here: 
https://github.com/roshankoirala/Machine_learning-

While doing exercise, codes are implemented using the python packages. This was indeed the intiention of the book ISLR, viz to teach students to use the R-packages to solve the statistical learning problems. 

The topics included are: 
00. Data Exploration 
01. Simple Linear Regression
02. Multiple Linear Regression 
03. K_Nearest Neighbors 
04. Logistic Regression 
05. Linear Discriminant Analysis 
06. Cross Validation 
07. Bootstrap 
08. Subset Selection 
09. Shrinkage Method 
10. Dimensional Reduction 
11. Splines 
12. Decision Tree 
13. Random Forest 
14. Support Vector Machine 
15. Principle Component Analysis 
16. Clustering
